What is Irqbalance
==================

Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated by interrupts
across all of a systems cpus. Irqbalance identifies the highest volume
interrupt sources, and isolates each of them to a single unique cpu, so that
load is spread as much as possible over an entire processor set, while
minimizing cache miss rates for irq handlers.

## Building and Installing [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Irqbalance/irqbalance.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Irqbalance/irqbalance)

```bash
autoupdate ## May be required first time you build
./autogen.sh
./configure [options]
make
make install
```


_Note: If you see `This machine seems not NUMA capable.` in debug and you built the binary yourself, you are likely missing the numa headers. Check `config.log`._


### Ubuntu specific packages for building
```
sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get install -y glib2.0 libglib2.0-dev git autoconf automake libtool make gcc pkg-config libncurses-dev libnuma-dev
```


## Developing Irqbalance

Irqbalance is currently hosted on github, and so developers are welcome to use
the issue/pull request/etc infrastructure found there.  


## Bug reporting

When something goes wrong, feel free to send us bugreport by one of the ways
described above. Your report should include:

* Irqbalance version you've been using (or commit hash)
* `/proc/interrupts` output
* `irqbalance --debug` output
* content of smp_affinity files - can be obtained by e.g.:
	`$ for i in $(seq 0 300); do grep . /proc/irq/$i/smp_affinity /dev/null 2>/dev/null; done`
* your hw hierarchy - e.g. `lstopo-no-graphics` output
